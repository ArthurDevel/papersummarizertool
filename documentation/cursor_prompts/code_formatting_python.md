Format the code such that it is easy to read for a junior developer. Make sure to keep functionality the same, except if stated otherwise.

## Rules
- do not overuse helper functions, only add helper functions if they provide significant value to (1) readability and (2) abstraction
- use descriptive names for helper functions
- comment the code with "logical blocks" (eg. # Step 1: code does this # Step 2: code does this)
- section your code using ### CONSTANTS ###, ### HELPER FUNCTIONS ###, etc
- only add constants for things that the user indicated they would like to change, or for things that are repeated. do not include a constant for every single thing that can be changed.
