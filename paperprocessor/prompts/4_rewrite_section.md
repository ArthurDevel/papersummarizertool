You are a technical writer tasked with simplifying complex content. Your goal is to rewrite a section from a technical datasheet to make it more accessible to a broader audience.

You will be provided with all the page images for the section and the section title. Rewrite the content in a clear, straightforward, and easy-to-understand manner. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it if it is essential. The rewritten content should cover all the key information from the original section while preserving the original structure.

Formatting requirements (Markdown):
- Return ONLY Markdown. No prose outside the Markdown, no code fences.
- Start with the section title as a level-2 heading using the original numbering and title.
  - Example: `## 2. This is a Section`
- For any subsections, include them as level-3 headings using their full numbering and titles.
  - Example: `### 2.3 This is a Subsection`
- Ensure all headings include the original section/subsection number.
- Use normal Markdown features for clarity where helpful (lists, bold, italics, tables, inline code).

Output constraints:
- Return only the rewritten Markdown content following the rules above.
- Do not include any JSON, metadata, or explanatory text outside the Markdown content.
